# ScoriaPy

ScoriaPy is a lightweight utility library built on top of Scanpy.
It organizes helper functions following the Scanpy namespace design:

- `scoriapy.pp` — preprocessing utilities
- `scoriapy.tl` — tools/analysis utilities
- `scoriapy.pl` — plotting utilities
- `scoriapy.utils` — generic helpers (logging, markers, etc.)

This package is intended for flexible, incremental development of Scanpy pipelines.
